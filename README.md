# Tweet card

This application is based on create-react-app. The page renders a list of tweet cards that have their own unique random avatar, the number of followers and posts. When you click on the button, the number of followers in the card, the name of the button and the color change. The data is recorded in **localstorage**, and when the page is reloaded, the card view that was before the reload is saved. The application is deployed on [Vercel]https://tweet-card-chi.vercel.app/.
